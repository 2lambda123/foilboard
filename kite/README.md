## KiteFoils

This folder provides a few html files defining some kite foils. A few of these come with exact measurements and profile outlines, the rest  are not. 

A few screenshots with the results shown below. To save space,
the "Summary" tab  on most screenshots was placed over the Results panel,
so that the Plot tab cam also be shown.

### MHL Lift 2016

Notes: Stab camber and AoA *guestimated* but appear close to real.  

### Mike's Lab 2016 Race Foil
![MikesLab foil results](MikesLab-foil-results.png)

Notes. Stab camber and AoA are close to real (Sonny S)

### Air Chair 90 WaterSki Hydrofoi

![Air Chair Alum](air-chair-results.png)

Notes: The incidence angles are measured by the author, not guesstimated. 
Cl/Cd data derived from actual airfoil profiles.  These profiles were never meant
to be optimized and are draggy - Air Chair is originally boat-tow watercraft, but was used successfully for kiting and windowing.   For windfoiling, it is necessary to extend the fuselage forward, so that the wing can be mounted 90-100mm forward. 

### Liquid Force Happy Foil 2017

Notes: Wing and stab profiles and incidences  are actual  measurements by Ken Poulton

### Liquid Force Rocket 2015

![liquid force rocket foil](liquid-force-rocket-foil-results.png)

Note: Cl/Cd data derived from actual airfoil profiles.  Stab with 0.5 AoA. Ken's measurements for stab incidence: stock: -0.05, with   Ken's shim (rides much better, still rider's CG needs be *wa-a-ay* back):  -0.55
